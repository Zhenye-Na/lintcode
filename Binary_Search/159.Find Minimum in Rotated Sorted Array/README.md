# 159. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

**Description**

Suppose a sorted array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., `0 1 2 4 5 6 7` might become `4 5 6 7 0 1 2`).

Find the minimum element.

> You can assume no duplicate exists in the array.

**Example**


Example 1:

```
Input: [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]
Output: 0

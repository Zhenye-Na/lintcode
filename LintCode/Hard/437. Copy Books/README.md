# 437. Copy Books

- **Description**
    - Given `n` books and the $i_{th}$ book has `A[i]` pages. You are given `k` people to copy the `n` books.
    - `n` books list in a row and each person can claim a continous range of the n books. For example one copier can copy the books from ith to jth continously, but he can not copy the 1st book, 2nd book and 4th book (without 3rd book).
    - They start copying books at the same time and they all cost 1 minute to copy 1 page of a book. What's the best strategy to assign books so that the slowest copier can finish at earliest time?  
- **Example**
    - Given array `A = [3,2,4]`, `k = 2`.
    - Return `5`( First person spends 5 minutes to copy book 1 and book 2 and second person spends 4 minutes to copy book 3. )
- **Challenge**
    - 时间复杂度 `O(nk)`

# 114. Unique Paths

**Description**

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a `m x n` grid.

The robot can only move either `down` or `right` at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the `bottom-right` corner of the grid.

How many possible unique paths are there?

`m` and `n` will be at most 100.

**Example**

Example 1:

```
Input: n = 1, m = 3
Output: 1	
Explanation: Only one path to target position.
```

Example 2:

```
Input:  n = 3, m = 3
Output: 6	
Explanation:
	D : Down
	R : Right
	1) DDRR
	2) DRDR
	3) DRRD
	4) RRDD
	5) RDRD
	6) RDDR
```
